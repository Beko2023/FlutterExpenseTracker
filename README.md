While building this app I've deepened my understanding of basic Flutter features including;
- Themeing to efficiently style apps
- Useful tools such as; snack bars, modal bottom sheet with text fields, a drop down buttons and a manual date picker.

We also used show dialog to improve any foreseeable UX issues for the form and added a dismissible widget feature to side swipe list items to remove them and more!
